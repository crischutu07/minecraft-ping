# workers-minecraft-ping
A test use case of using Cloudflare Workers to ping minecraft servers.

This project currently does not work as the Cloudflare Worker runtime does not support tcp sockets. They are in closed alpha at the time of writing this and hasn't shown any evidence of being available any time soon.
